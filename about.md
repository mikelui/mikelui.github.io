I'm Mike. 
I do research in hardware-software co-design and enjoy taking an active role in education,
both at the university I work at and in teaching younger generations.
My technical interests are centered around exploring how hardware architectures are influenced,
both by the raw algorithms they compute as well as by the way those algorithms are expressed.
Even with my research and tech interests,
I believe it is important to stay balanced physically and spiritually.
You may find some of my thoughts on this sprinkled between my more tech-oriented posts.

I received my dual BS/MS from Drexel University in 2012.
Afterwards, I worked as a multimedia hardware verification engineer for a couple years.
Eventually I returned to Drexel University to pursue a PhD and gain further expertise in my area.
Currently I am a [PhD candidate at Drexel University](http://vlsi.ece.drexel.edu/index.php?title=Michael_Lui)
where I study hardware-software co-design techniques.
